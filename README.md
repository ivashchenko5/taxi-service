## About a project
<a id="about-a-project"></a>

Taxi-service it's a __web application__.<br>
Basic implementation of a taxi service.
Allows you to use basic __CRUD operations__,
as well as __create__, __authenticate__ and __authorize__ a new drivers,
add a cars and a manufacturers to the __database__.
Other than key __CRUD__ operations there are other __features__ like adding 
driver to a car and showing a list of cars for currently logged in driver.
It is a training project that was created to show my skills in __JavaCore__, __JDBC__, and __Web__.

_I do not use "Hibernate" and "Spring Framework" 
to better understand how a web application works in more depth_.
